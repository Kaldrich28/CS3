			<h1>One Punch Man</h1>
			<p>	One Punch Man is one my favorite because of it's animation, story line and humor.
				<br>The Protagonist is a bald man named Saitama, from the name of the anime; 
				<br>he's overpowered and can kill his enemies in just one punch without even trying he even destoyed Jupiter just by sneezing.</p>
